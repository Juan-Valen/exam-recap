## Code auth
- Overall the testing and endpoint work as they should.
- The server could send the role along-side the token so that the front-end could let only the admin and moderator edit and add properties.
- The front-end looks okay, but it need improvement in the UX/UI.
- Better placeholder could have been used in the inputs.
